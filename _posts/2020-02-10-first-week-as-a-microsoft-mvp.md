Wow, I can't believe it's already been a week. Receiving my Microsoft MVP award in Developer Technologies on February 1st 2020 was literally a dream come true. I was sitting in my hotel room in London, after just have spoken at NDC London 2020 when I saw the e-mail. It's such a surreal feeling, but one filled with so much joy and happiness.

**So how does one become an MVP?**

On Microsoft's website, it reads as follows:

Like so many other Microsoft MVPs, my goal was never to obtain the MVP award for the sake of the award itself. As much as I appreciate the award and value it, I see it as a recognition that my contributions to the developer community are seen as valuable, and I'm very humbled by that fact. There are many roads that may lead to an MVP award, but they all start with your passion. What are you passionate about? What motivates you to expand outside your comfort zone, so that you can mentor and help others? For me that was the quest to make machine learning more accessible for .NET developers. 

**How do I get started?**

If I look back at my own career, I contributed very little to the developer community just two years ago. As many others, I had 10s if not 100s of open-source dependencies to the application I was developing, and happily consumed blog-posts with neat solutions to the problems I was facing. It was not that I didn't want to contribute, I just didn't know where to start. For me that all changed when I started working for my current employer Excella. The firm consists of so many smart people, that either run successful open-source repos on the side or are published authors. Working in that kind of environment really inspired me. I'm not saying you need to change job to get started, but what I would suggest is to seek out a mentor in the open-source community that can be your partner and help you navigate where you can get started today. I'm more than willing to pair up with if you are interested, feel free to reach out!

Know that there are many ways you can contribute, and you don't need to do them all (in fact I would advise against it). If you like writing you may want to start writing blog posts. If you like producing videos, consider streaming on Twitch or Youtube while you work through some code. If you like me really enjoy teaching people face-to-face, consider submitting abstract o Meetups and conferences. Another great way to get engaged in the community is to help organize a Meetup. As Meetup organizer myself, I will say that help is always more than welcomed. If you are attending a Meetup regularly, reach out to the organizers and see if there's anything you can do. I promise you that you'll meet so many new friends. 



**Why is it so awesome being an MPV?**
