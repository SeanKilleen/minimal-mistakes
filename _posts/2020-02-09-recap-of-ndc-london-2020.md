This year I was fortunate to have been invited to speak at NDC London, hosted between January 28-31st. It was my first NDC conference, and let me tell you what an amazing experience it was. NDC Conferences has over the last couple of years quickly grown from its original location of Oslo, Norway, to also have a presence in London, Porto, Sydney and as of most recently Minnesota and Melbourne. Speakers fly in from all over the world, and among them you'll find community leaders as well as representatives from the larger tech firms such as Microsoft and Amazon. It's a perfect mix. 

Over 800 people attended NDC London this year, and the topics presented ranged from everything from cyber security with Troy Hunt to the latest and greatest of Blazor by Carl Franklin. So what were some key takeaways?

Let me summarize a couple:

**Blazor** is no longer just a trend and something Microsoft is just playing around with. The framework has really matured in the last year, and it is evident that both Microsoft and the community is quickly adopting it. We have yet to see if this will be the new Silverlight, but I've personally decided to learn more about server and client-side Blazor this year, and see where it would fit in existing and new projects.

**.NET Core** - wow, there were so many good talks on .NET Core. Yes it's been out for a couple of years now, but with v3.x, a lot of companies are seriously looking to migrate their old legacy .NET Framework monoliths. To be frank, the client for which I'm currently helping has just started to take this leap. 

**Machine Learning** is becoming more and more mainstream, and I can see that a lot of talks are moving away from the general introduction to actually looking at applied ML. I may be a bit biased here as I personally gave a workshop on the open-source, cross-platform library ML.NET, but I would say that the interest is there. Developers want to know more about ML and how it fits into their application, but it may sometimes be difficult to know where to start. I'm hoping to change that in 2020
